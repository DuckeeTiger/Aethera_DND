# Sorcerer
*A Dazzling Mage Filled with Innate Magic*

Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.
 
Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.
 
Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting
Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer spell list later in the class’s description.

**Cantrips.** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. *Light*, *Prestidigitation*, *Shocking Grasp*, and *Sorcerous Burst* are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Features table.

**Spell Slots.** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. *Burning Hands* and *Detect Magic* are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

---
#### Level 1: Innate Sorcery
An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:
- The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
- You have Advantage on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.

---
#### Level 2: Metamagic
Your magic flows from within; you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from "Metamagic Options" later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

---
#### Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass
You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The Aberrant Mind, Clockwork Soul, Draconic Sorcery, and Wild Magic Sorcery subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.

---
#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.

---
#### Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration
When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

---
#### Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate
If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic options on each spell you cast.

---
#### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Dimensional Travel is recommended.

---
#### Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis
While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use one Metamagic option on each of your turns without spending Sorcery Points on it.


## Sorcerer Metamagic Options

The following options are available to your Metamagic feature. The options are presented in alphabetical order.

---
#### Careful Spell
**Cost: 1 Sorcery Point.** When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

---
#### Distant Spell
**Cost: 1 Sorcery Point.** When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to make the spell’s range 30 feet.

---
#### Empowered Spell
**Cost: 1 Sorcery Point.** When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls. You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

---
#### Extended Spell
**Cost: 1 Sorcery Point.** When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours. If the affected spell requires Concentration, you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to maintain that Concentration.

---
#### Heightened Spell
**Cost: 2 Sorcery Points.** When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves against the spell.

---
#### Quickened Spell
**Cost: 2 Sorcery Points.** When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting. You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way.

---
#### Seeking Spell
**Cost: 1 Sorcery Point.** If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll. You can use Seeking Spell even if you’ve already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

---
#### Subtle Spell
**Cost: 1 Sorcery Point.** When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a cost specified in the spell.

---
#### Transmuted Spell
**Cost: 1 Sorcery Point.** When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Thunder.

---
#### Twinned Spell
**Cost: 1 Sorcery Point.** When you cast a spell, such as Charm Person, that can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the spell’s effective level by 1.

# Varázsló (*Sorcerer*)
*Egy Veleszületett Mágiával Átitatott Ragyogó Mágus*

A Varázslók velük született mágiát irányítanak, amely lényükbe van vésve. Egyes Varázslók nem tudják megnevezni erejük eredetét, míg mások személyes vagy családi történetük különös eseményeire vezetik vissza azt. Egy sárkány vagy dryád áldása egy újszülött fölött, vagy egy tiszta égboltból lecsapó villámcsapás is felébresztheti a varázserőt. Ugyanígy eredhet az ajándék egy istenségtől, egy másik létsík különös energiáitól vagy a valóság belső működésének futó megpillantásától. Bármi is legyen az eredet, az eredmény ugyanaz: kitörölhetetlen nyom a Varázslón, egy fortyogó mágia, amely akár generációkon át öröklődhet.

A Varázslók nem tanulják a mágiát; a nyers, kavargó erő része a lényüknek. A Varázsló művészete abban rejlik, hogy megtanulja irányítani és csatornázni ezt a veleszületett mágiát, és így új, lenyűgöző módokon szabadíthatja fel erejét. Ahogy a Varázsló egyre inkább uralja veleszületett mágiáját, úgy válik egyre összhangba annak eredetével, különleges képességeket fejlesztve, amelyek annak forrását tükrözik.

A Varázslók ritkák. Egyes családi vérvonalak minden generációban pontosan egy Varázslót adnak a világnak, míg máskor a mágia tehetsége csupán véletlenszerűen bukkan fel. Akik ezt az erőt hordozzák, hamar rájönnek, hogy a mágia nem szeret csöndben maradni: használni akarják.

| A Varázsló Alaptulajdonságai | < |
| :--------------------------- | :- |
| **Elsődleges Főérték**       | Karizma |

| **Páncélviselés**            | Nincs |
