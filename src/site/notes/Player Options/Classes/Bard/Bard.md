# Bard
*An Inspiring Performer of Music, Dance and Magic*

Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language.

Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.

A Bard’s life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards’ depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

#### Level 1: Bardic Inspiration
You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

Using Bardic Inspiration. As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.

Number of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

At Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See the Player’s Handbook for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells.

**Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. [[Player Options/Spells/Detailed Spells/Dancing Lights\|Dancing Lights]] and [[Vicious Mockery\|Vicious Mockery]] are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

**Spell Slots.** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. [[Player Options/Spells/Detailed Spells/Charm Person\|Charm Person]], [[Player Options/Spells/Detailed Spells/Color Spray\|Color Spray]], [[Dissonant Whispers\|Dissonant Whispers]], and [[Healing Word\|Healing Word]] are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table.

**Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.

---
#### Level 10: Magical Secrets

# Bárd (*Bard*)
*A zene, tánc és mágia inspiráló előadója*

A bárdok zenén, táncon és költészeten keresztül idézik meg a mágiát. Kiválóak mások inspirálásában, sebek enyhítésében, ellenfelek elbátortalanításában és illúziók teremtésében. A bárdok úgy hiszik, a multiverzum a Teremtés Szavaiból született, és e szavak visszhangjai még mindig átszövik a létezés minden síkját. A bárdi mágia ezeknek a szavaknak az erejét próbálja megragadni — olyan szavakét, amelyek minden beszélt nyelvet felülmúlnak.

Szinte bármi képes új dal vagy történet megihletésére, ezért a bárdok szinte mindent érdekesnek találnak. Sok minden mestereivé válnak: a zenélésnek, a mágia használatának és a történetmesélésnek.

A bárdok élete utazással, történetek gyűjtésével és előadással telik, megélhetésüket pedig gyakran a közönség hálája biztosítja. Mély tudásuk és mágikus képességeik mégis kiemelik őket a hétköznapi előadóművészek közül.
