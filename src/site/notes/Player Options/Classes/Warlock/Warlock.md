# Warlock
*An Occultist Empowered by Otherworldly Pacts*

Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.
 
Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.
 
Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

--- 
#### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation Options” section.
 
Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.
 
Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.
 
When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.
 
You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

---
#### Level 1: Pact Magic
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells.
 
Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.
 
When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Features table.
 
Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
 
For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.
 
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells.
 
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.
 
If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.
 
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.
 
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.
 
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

---
#### Level 2: Magical Cunning
You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

---
#### Level 3: Warlock Subclass
You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower.

---
#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.
 
You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.

---
#### Level 9: Contact Patron
In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw.
 
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.

---
#### Level 11: Mystic Arcanum
Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.
 
You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.
 
As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a Long Rest.
 
Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.

---
#### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

---
#### Level 20: Eldritch Master
When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

# Boszorkánymester (*Warlock*)
*Egy Okkultista, akit Másvilági Paktumok Hatalmaznak Fel*

A boszorkánymesterek olyan tudást kutatnak, amely a multiverzum szövetébe rejtve lapul. Gyakran tiltott tudás könyveibe merülve, másvilági lények figyelmét vonzó invokációkat gyakorolva vagy olyan helyeket keresve indulnak el, ahol ezeknek a lényeknek az ereje érzékelhető. Hamarosan mindegyik Boszorkánymester kapcsolatba kerül egy erős patrónussal, és velük kötött paktum adja mágikus hatalmuk forrását.

A Boszorkánymesterek patrónusukat eszközként látják — egy útnak a mágikus hatalomhoz. Néhányan tisztelik vagy szeretik patrónusukat, mások kelletlenül szolgálják, megint mások pedig igyekeznek aláásni őket, miközben erejüket használják.

Miután a paktum létrejött, a tudás és hatalom utáni vágy soha nem csillapodik. A legtöbb Boszorkánymester élete a még mélyebb titkok és nagyobb hatalom kereséséről szól — ami gyakran kalandhoz vezet.

### 1. szint: Eldritch Invocations
Tiltott tudás töredékeit tártad fel — olyan invokációkat, amelyek maradandó mágiát vagy más különleges képességet adnak neked. Egy tetszőleges invokációval kezded (például a *Pact of the Tome*).

**Előfeltételek:** Ha egy invokációnak követelménye van (pl. min. 5. szintű Boszorkánymester), akkor csak akkor tanulhatod meg.

**Cserélés:** Minden szintlépéskor lecserélhetsz egy invokációt másikra, ha megfelelsz a követelményeinek. Nem cserélheted le, ha egy másik általad ismert invokáció előfeltétele.

Nem választhatod ugyanazt az invokációt többször, hacsak a leírása másképp nem rendelkezik.

---

### 1. szint: Pact Magic
Okult szertartás révén paktumot kötöttél egy titokzatos entitással. E paktum konkrét ereje: varázslatok használata.

**Cantrip-ek:** 2 Boszorkánymester cantripet ismersz. Minden szintlépéskor lecserélhetsz egyet.

**Varázslathelyek:** Csak 1–5. szint közötti varázslataid vannak, és minden Pact Magic varázslathelyed ugyanolyan szintű.  
A Boszorkánymester táblázat mutatja az aktuális slotok szintjét.  
Minden Short vagy Long Rest után visszanyered az összeset.

**Elkészített varázslatok:**  
Először 2 darab 1. szintű Boszorkánymester varázslatot készítesz elő. A szám növekszik, ahogy szinted nő.

Tetszőleges Warlock varázslatot választhatsz, amelynek szintje nem magasabb, mint amit a táblázat Slot Level oszlopa mutat.

**Csere:** Szintlépéskor lecserélhetsz egy előkészített varázslatot egy másikra.

**Varázsló Fókusz:** Használhatsz Arcane Focus-t fókuszként.

---

### 2. szint: Magical Cunning
Egy 1 perces szertartással visszanyerhetsz elköltött Pact Magic varázslathelyeket — legfeljebb a maximális slotjaid felét (felfelé kerekítve).  
Egyszer használhatod Long Restenként.

---

### 3. szint: Boszorkánymester Alkaszt
Válassz egy alkasztot (patront). A későbbiekben minden alkasztképességet megkapsz, amikor eléred a megfelelő szintet.

---

### 4. szint: Képességpont Növelés
Növelhetsz képességpontot vagy választhatsz egy featet.  
8., 12. és 16. szinten újra megkapod.

---

### 9. szint: Contact Patron
Mostantól közvetlenül kommunikálhatsz patrónusoddal.  
Mindig előkészítve van a *Contact Other Plane* varázslat, amit Slot nélkül is elvarázsolhatsz, és automatikusan sikerül a mentődobásod.

Egyszer használhatod Long Restenként.

---

### 11. szint: Mystic Arcanum
Patrónusod egy mágikus titkot, úgynevezett arcanumot ad neked.  
Válassz egy 6. szintű Warlock varázslatot, amit slot nélkül elvarázsolhatsz egyszer Long Restenként.

Később újabb arcanumokat kapsz (13. szint – 7. szintű varázslat; 15. szint – 8. szint; 17. szint – 9. szint).

Minden szintlépéskor kicserélheted az arcanumodat egy másik azonos szintű Warlock varázslatra.

---

### 19. szint: Epic Boon
Szerezz egy Epic Boon featet (vagy más, előfeltételnek megfelelő featet).

---

### 20. szint: Eldritch Master
Ha használod a Magical Cunning képességet, **az összes** Pact Magic slotodat visszanyered.
