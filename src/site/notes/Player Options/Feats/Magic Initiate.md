*Origin Feat*

You gain the following benefits.
- **Two Cantrips.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the [[Player Options/Classes/Cleric/Cleric\|Cleric]], [[Player Options/Classes/Druid/Druid\|Druid]], or [[Player Options/Classes/Wizard/Wizard\|Wizard]] spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feat's spells (choose when you select this feat).
- **Level 1 Spell.** Choose a level 1 spell from the same list you selected for this feat's cantrips. You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.
- **Spell Change.** Whenever you gain a new level, you can replace one of the spells you chose for this feat with a different spell of the same level from the chosen spell list.

**Repeatable**. You can take this feat more than once, but you must choose a different spell list each time.
