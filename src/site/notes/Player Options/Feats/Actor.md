*General Feat (Prerequisite: Level 4+, Charisma 13+)*

You gain the following benefits.
- ***Ability Score Increase.*** Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- ***Impersonation.*** While you're disguised as a real or fictional person, you have Advantage on Charisma (Deception or Performance) checks to convince others that you are that person.
- ***Mimicry.*** You can mimic the sounds of other creatures, including speech. A creature that hears the mimicry must succeed on a Wisdom (Insight) check to determine the effect is faked (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
