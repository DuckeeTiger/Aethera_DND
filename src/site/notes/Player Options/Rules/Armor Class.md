A creature’s Armor Class represents how well the creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC of a character is determined at character creation whereas the AC of a monster appears in its stat block.

**_Calculating AC._** All creatures start with the same base AC calculation:
- **Base AC** = 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modifier

A creature’s AC can then be modified by armor, magic items, spells, and more.

**_Only One Base AC._** Some spells and class features give characters a different way to calculate their AC. A character with multiple features that give different ways to calculate AC must choose which one to use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a creature.
