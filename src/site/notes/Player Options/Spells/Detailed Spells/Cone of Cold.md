*Level 5 Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** Self
**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a blast of cold air. Each creature in a 60-foot Cone originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 5.
