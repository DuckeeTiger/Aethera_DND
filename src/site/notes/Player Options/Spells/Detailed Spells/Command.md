You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. Choose the command from these options:

**Approach.** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.
**Drop.** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
**Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.
**Grovel.** The target has the Prone condition and then ends its turn.
**Halt.** On its turn, the target doesn't move and takes no action or Bonus Action.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can affect one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
