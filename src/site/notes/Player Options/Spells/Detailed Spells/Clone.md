*8th level Necromancy ([[Player Options/Classes/Artificer/Artificer\|Artificer]], [[Player Options/Classes/Wizard/Wizard\|Wizard]])*
**Casting Time:** 1 Hour
**Range:** Touch
**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes, and a sealable vessel worth 2,000+ GP that is large enough to hold the creature being cloned)
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature or at least 1 cubic inch of its flesh. An inert duplicate of that creature forms inside the vessel used in the spell's casting and finishes growing after 120 days; you choose whether the finished clone is the same age as the creature or younger. The clone remains inert and endures indefinitely while its vessel remains undisturbed.

If the original creature dies after the clone finishes forming, the creature's soul transfers to the clone if the soul is free and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's equipment. The creature's original remains, if any, become inert and can't be revived, since the creature's soul is elsewhere.

## Cloud of Daggers
*2nd level Conjuration ([[Player Options/Classes/Artificer/Artificer\|Artificer]], [[Player Options/Classes/Bard/Bard\|Bard]], [[Player Options/Classes/Sorcerer/Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]], [[Player Options/Classes/Warlock/Warlock\|Warlock]], [[Player Options/Classes/Wizard/Wizard\|Wizard]])*
**Casting Time:** Action
**Range:** 60 feet
**Components:** V, S, M (a sliver of glass)
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot Cube centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area takes 4d4 Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the Cube or ends its turn there or if the Cube moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.

On your later turns, you can take a Magic action to teleport the Cube up to 30 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 2d4 for each spell slot level above 2.
